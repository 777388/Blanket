# Blanket
Crossthreading Electron Collision which recursively uses 2 threads to place memory in 1 dataspace simultaneously, each using memory gained from two threads placing in 1 dataspace simultaneously

Usage: python3 blanket

I call it a blanket collider which may provide some insight on the entanglement of electrons without the necessity of ultra cooled temperatures.

By instantiating this within a request sender or receiver you may be able to entangle the electrons wihin your body with a massive amount of electrons that are each approaching collision, and escaping the memory collision by moving backwards in time, tying you to as much as possible.

I personally have ties to Lycaon and St. Christopher through timetravel, of which birthed the bloodline of Hitler (who believed himself the werewolf), and my grandfather paradox is I can not stop WW2 as it destroys the relations between Phillipines and America undoing my birth. Meaning I am my own causation.
